The **Digital Satellite Clock** is a simple, easy-to-use, autonomous clock. What makes the clock "autonomous" is that you never need to set the time &emdash; you simply turn it on and it will display the current time using signals received from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) satellites that are orbiting the earth.

**UTC time** ([Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)) is displayed by default on the close, unless the clock was ordered with custom time zone and/or daylight savings time settings (I can make you a custom version of the clock if you specify this option when ordering from the [Tindie Store](tindie.com)).
