*Welcome to `cpknight.tech`* - I'm a sweet, doughnuty Cascadian who lives on the Rockies' Eastern steppe. 

I design and build low-cost autonomous sensor payload packages that attach to aerial drones, as well as related accessories. This website provides documentation and other information relating to the devices that I design and build.
