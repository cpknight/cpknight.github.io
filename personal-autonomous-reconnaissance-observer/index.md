**Paro** is a "Personal Autonomous Reconnaissance Observer" device - it's a simple black box that observes the world around it and reports what it sees back to you. It's a personal device designed to help you out with its various sensors so that you can sense things that you might not be able to on your own or so it can make observations while you're not around. It does this autonomously so you don't have to monitor it all the time while your attention is elsewhere. Plus it's loaded with reconnaissance algorithms that have been created (and adopted) specifically for Paro, so you can choose from a long list of observations that your Paro device can make for you.

Paro devices enable autonomous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities in remote and harsh environments, including from aerial vehicles. They are currently in initial production for an open (public) beta-testing program. You can participate in the beta program - please contact chris@cpknight.io for details.
